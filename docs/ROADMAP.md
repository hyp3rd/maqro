# Maqro roadmap — accuracy, ergonomics, breadth, depth

> Status of the product: the core (calculator, AI meal planning + deterministic
> fallback, photo/voice/barcode logging, recipes, pantry/shopping, micronutrients,
> sync modes, 3‑tier billing, passkeys/MFA, push/email) is mature and shipped.
> These four initiatives are the highest‑leverage _next_ work — they add accuracy,
> daily ergonomics, expected breadth, and goal depth without diluting the
> local‑first / privacy‑first positioning.

Sequenced by leverage:

1. **Adaptive TDEE loop** ← in progress
1. **Logging quick‑add** (recent / favorites / copy‑a‑meal)
1. **Breadth** — water/hydration + meal timestamps → eating windows / fasting
1. **Goal phases** (cut → diet break → maintenance → lean bulk)

A deliberate non‑goal list lives at the bottom.

## 1. Adaptive TDEE loop — _in progress_

**Problem.** TDEE is currently `BMR × activityMultiplier`, where the multiplier
comes from a static dropdown ([components/macro/types.ts](../components/macro/types.ts)).
That dropdown is the single biggest source of error in any macro app. We already
_detect_ plateaus and _suggest_ a recalibration ([lib/trends.ts](../lib/trends.ts)
`recalibrateTdee`), but it's advisory‑only and requires the user to copy a number
into the Calculator's manual‑TDEE field. Two weaknesses: it's a manual loop, and
its math assumes the user ate **exactly to target**.

**Approach — the dynamic / energy‑balance method.** Infer maintenance directly
from what the user _actually logged_ vs. how their weight _actually moved_:

```text
observedTDEE ≈ mean(daily logged intake)  −  (weight‑trend slope × 7700 kcal/kg)
```

This beats `recalibrateTdee` because it reads real intake from the logs (no
"ate to target" assumption) and is self‑consistent under a _consistent_ logging
bias — if you under‑count by 10% every day, the inferred maintenance is in your
own logged units and a target set from it still produces the intended trend.
(Failure mode is _inconsistent_ logging → gated by a coverage threshold.)

**Algorithm** — `inferAdaptiveTdee()` in [lib/trends.ts](../lib/trends.ts):

- Smoothed weight series (reuse `smoothWeights`, 7‑day SMA) over a 28‑day window.
- Weight slope via least‑squares fit over the smoothed window (steadier than an
  endpoint difference).
- Mean logged intake over the **same** interval (logged days only, calories > 0).
- `observedTDEE = meanIntake − slopeKgPerDay × 7700`, rounded to 10 kcal, clamped
  to the manual‑TDEE bounds [800, 6000].
- Confidence (`none|low|medium|high`) from window span, weigh‑in count, and
  logged‑day coverage. Returns `observedTdee: null` until there's enough data
  (≥14‑day span, ≥10 logged days).

**Data model.** No migration for the MVP — computed on the fly from existing
`weightHistory` + `dailyLogs`. (A future `tdeeEstimates`/target‑history store would
power a "TDEE over time" chart and an auto‑adapt audit trail.)

**UX surfaces.**

- **Progress → Trends** ([ProgressView.tsx](../components/macro/ProgressView.tsx)
  `TrendsSection`): replace the advisory‑only card with an actionable one —
  observed maintenance + confidence + comparison to current target + **"Use this
  as my TDEE"** one‑click apply (`patchProfile("manualTdee", …)` → `computeMacros`
  re‑derives everything).
- **Calculator → manual‑TDEE field** ([PersonalInfoForm.tsx](../components/macro/PersonalInfoForm.tsx)):
  a "Suggested from your trend: X" badge + Apply.

**Pro‑gating (proposed, needs sign‑off).** Keep the _estimate + one‑click apply_
**free** — gating accuracy/honesty feels wrong and it's the core trust story.
Gate **auto‑adapt** (hands‑off weekly re‑estimation that nudges the target) and a
**TDEE‑over‑time history chart** as **Pro** — that gives Pro genuine intelligence
beyond "sync + micronutrients."

**Open decisions (for sign‑off before UI wiring).**

1. Free vs. Pro split (above).
1. Suggest‑with‑one‑click‑apply (MVP) vs. opt‑in auto‑apply (Pro, phase 2).
1. Surface: Trends card only, or also the Calculator badge.

**Status.** Estimator + unit tests landed in `lib/trends.ts` / `lib/trends.test.ts`.
UI wiring pending the decisions above.

## 2. Logging quick‑add — _planned_

**Problem.** The highest‑frequency action is re‑logging the same foods. Templates
exist but are heavyweight (explicit save, separate view). No recent/frequent list,
no "copy yesterday's dinner."

**Approach.**

- **Recent foods**: derive from `dailyLogs` (last N distinct `FoodItem`s) — no new
  store; a ranked, de‑duplicated read.
- **Frequent / favorites**: a lightweight `favoriteFoods` store _or_ a frequency
  score over recent logs; one‑tap add to the current meal.
- **Copy a meal**: "re‑add" a previous day's meal slot into today.

**Data model.** Possibly a small `favoriteFoods` IDB store (synced); recent foods
need none.

**UX.** Surface inside the existing guided log flow ([LogMealSheet.tsx](../components/macro/LogMealSheet.tsx))
as a "Recent" / "Frequent" method tile, and a "Copy from a previous day" affordance.

**Gating.** Free (it's core ergonomics).

**Open questions.** Favorites = explicit star vs. auto‑frequency? Recent‑foods
window size.

## 3. Breadth — hydration + eating windows / fasting — _planned_

**Problem.** No water tracking (universally expected), and logs are keyed by date
with meals as _slots_ — there's **no time‑of‑day** anywhere, which blocks IF /
eating‑window tracking and meal‑timing insights.

**Approach.**

- **Hydration**: a `waterIntake` store (`{date, ml}`) + a tap‑to‑add counter with a
  goal; show on Progress.
- **Meal timestamps**: add an optional `loggedAt`/`time` to logged meals (additive,
  back‑compatible). Unlocks: eating‑window length, first/last‑meal times, "% of
  calories after 8pm," and a simple fast timer.

**Data model.** New `waterIntake` store; additive optional timestamp on meal/log
records (no breaking change). Both synced.

**UX.** Water widget on Calculator/Progress; eating‑window summary + optional fast
timer; timing insights feed the existing meal‑insights engine.

**Gating.** Water free; advanced timing insights a candidate Pro hook.

**Open questions.** Where the fast timer lives; default hydration goal (formula vs.
fixed); whether timing is per‑meal or per‑food.

---

## 4. Goal phases — _planned_

**Problem.** Goals are linear (`lose|maintain|gain` + `weeklyRateKg`). Serious users
run _phases_: a cut, a diet break / refeed, maintenance, a lean bulk — with planned
transitions. The plateau/recalibration machinery is begging for this.

**Approach.** A `goalPhases` concept: an ordered list of `{type, startDate,
durationWeeks, weeklyRateKg}` that drives the active target by date, with scheduled
transitions and gentle nudges ("diet break recommended after 10 weeks of deficit").
Integrates with Adaptive TDEE (re‑estimate maintenance at each phase boundary).

**Data model.** A `goalPhases` store (or a `phases` array on the profile), synced.
Likely wants the target‑history store deferred from initiative 1.

**UX.** A phase planner in Settings/Calculator; the active phase shown on the
dashboard; phase transitions surfaced in Trends.

**Gating.** Strong **Pro** candidate (depth for the precise audience).

**Open questions.** Preset templates (e.g., "12‑wk cut → 2‑wk break") vs. fully
custom; how aggressively to auto‑advance phases.

## Deliberate non‑goals (for now)

- **Social / community / leaderboards** — dilutes the no‑tracking, privacy‑first
  positioning; huge surface. Skip unless it becomes the whole strategy.
- **Proprietary barcode/nutrition DB** — Open Food Facts already covers
  barcode→macros; don't try to out‑database the incumbents.
- **Freeform "AI coach" chatbot** — targeted AI (insights, planning) already exists;
  tightening the TDEE loop beats a chat surface on ROI and risk.
